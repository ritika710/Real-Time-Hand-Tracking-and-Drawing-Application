# Real-Time Hand Tracking and Drawing Application

This project implements a real-time painting application utilizing hand tracking technology. Using OpenCV for computer vision, NumPy for numerical operations, and MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, users can draw on a digital canvas through simple hand gestures.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Detects hand gestures and translates them into drawing actions.
- **Color Selection:** Choose from blue, green, red, and yellow colors with on-screen buttons.
- **Dynamic Drawing:** Draw lines on the canvas by moving your hand in front of the webcam.
- **Canvas Clearing:** Clear the entire canvas with a designated button.
